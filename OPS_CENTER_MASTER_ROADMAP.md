# Ops-Center Master Roadmap & Status

**Last Updated**: October 28, 2025, 11:45 PM
**Version**: 5.1 - Multi-App Architecture Clarification
**Overall Status**: **90% COMPLETE** 🎉

---

## 🎯 VISION & ARCHITECTURE

### The Three Pillars

1. **Ops-Center** - Central management hub (THIS PROJECT)
2. **Brigade** - AI agent platform (integrated via A2A)
3. **Center-Deep** - Search & research platform (integrated)

### User Types (RBAC Model)

- **System Admin** - Platform-wide management (full access)
- **Org Admin** - Organization-level management
- **End User** - Personal subscription, usage, settings

### Multi-App Architecture

UC-Cloud is a **multi-service ecosystem** with **centralized authentication and billing**:

**Services**:
1. **Ops-Center** (THIS PROJECT) - https://unicorncommander.ai:8084
   - Central management dashboard
   - User/org administration
   - Billing & subscription management
   - LLM infrastructure routing

2. **Brigade** - https://brigade.unicorncommander.ai
   - AI agent factory (build, manage, deploy agents)
   - 48+ pre-built agents
   - Tool execution system
   - Agent API endpoints
   - **Database**: Separate `brigade_db` in shared PostgreSQL
   - **LLM Routing**: Uses Ops-Center API for billing integration

3. **Center-Deep** - https://search.unicorncommander.ai
   - AI-powered metasearch engine (70+ search engines)
   - Tool servers for specialized search
   - Admin panel for search configuration
   - **Separate service** with own admin

4. **Open-WebUI** - https://chat.unicorncommander.ai
   - Chat interface for LLMs
   - MCP tool usage
   - Multi-model conversations

**Shared Infrastructure**:
- ✅ **Keycloak SSO** (uchub realm) - Single authentication for ALL services
- ✅ **PostgreSQL** - Shared container, separate databases per service
- ✅ **Redis** - Shared cache and session storage
- ✅ **Traefik** - Shared reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
- ✅ **Lago + Stripe** - Centralized billing (managed via Ops-Center)

**Key Insight**: It's NOT "each app has its own admin and users" - instead:
- **Centralized users**: Keycloak manages authentication for all services
- **Centralized billing**: Ops-Center manages subscriptions and tiers
- **Service-specific data**: Each service stores its own operational data
- **Shared subscription tiers**: All services use the same pricing model

### Edge Device Management (Organizations)

**New Capability** (Epic 7.1 - Planned):

Organizations can deploy **edge devices** (laptops, workstations) that:
- Run local LLM models (Ollama, vLLM)
- Have their own local Keycloak instance
- Are **centrally managed** by cloud UC-Cloud

**Architecture**:
```
Cloud UC-Cloud (unicorncommander.ai)
    │
    ├── Organization A
    │   ├── Cloud users (browser-based)
    │   └── Edge Devices (managed fleet)
    │       ├── Laptop 1 (Ollama, local Keycloak)
    │       ├── Laptop 2 (vLLM, local Keycloak)
    │       └── Workstation 3 (local models)
    │
    └── Organization B
        ├── Cloud users
        └── Edge Devices
            └── Laptop 4 (hybrid cloud/local)
```

**Features**:
- **Device Registration**: Edge devices register with cloud UC-Cloud
- **Configuration Sync**: Cloud pushes configs to edge devices
- **Model Management**: Deploy/update local models remotely
- **Monitoring**: Cloud monitors edge device health and usage
- **Billing**: Usage from edge devices attributed to organization
- **Failover**: Edge devices can work offline, sync when reconnected
- **Security**: Edge devices authenticate to cloud for management
- **Keycloak Federation**: Local Keycloak instances federate with cloud

**Use Cases**:
- Organizations with high-security requirements (data never leaves premises)
- Remote workers with powerful laptops running local models
- Hybrid deployment (some workloads cloud, some edge)
- Reduced latency for local inference
- Cost optimization (use local GPU vs cloud API calls)

### User Role Tiers (5 RBAC Levels)

**Platform Access Levels**:
1. **System Admin** - Platform-wide management (full access)
2. **Org Admin** - Organization-level management
3. **Developer** - Service access, API keys, development tools
4. **Analyst** - Read-only analytics, reports
5. **Viewer** - Basic read access

### Subscription Pricing (3 Tiers)

**1. VIP/Founder/Internal** - $0/month (Invite-Only)
- For: Founder's friends, admins, staff, partners
- No monthly credits included
- Must buy credits separately as needed
- Full platform access
- Direct support from founders
- **Not publicly available** - invite code required

**2. BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** - $30/month
- Use your own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- No platform markup - direct passthrough
- No credits needed (you manage your own billing)
- Priority support
- API key management interface

**3. Managed (Default)** - $50/month ⭐ Recommended
- Use Ops-Center's LLM routing infrastructure
- May include monthly credits (amount TBD)
- Platform manages all API keys
- Automatic billing and usage tracking
- Priority support
- Access to all 100+ models via OpenRouter

**Credit System**:
- **Credits**: Pre-paid balance used for LLM API calls (Managed tier only)
- **Purchase Anytime**: All users can buy credits separately
- **Free Credits**: Platform may give out promotional credits
  - OpenRouter credits (available now)
  - Google Cloud credits (coming soon)
- **Usage Metering**: Tracks every API call, LLM token, agent execution
- **Billing Attribution**:
  - User → charges their credit balance
  - Organization → charges org's shared balance
  - Agent → when Brigade agent calls LLM via Ops-Center
- **No Markup for BYOK**: Direct passthrough to your API keys

**Legacy Code Note**:
Old tier definitions exist in codebase (Trial, Free, Starter, Professional, Enterprise) from previous pricing model. These will be migrated to the new 3-tier structure: Advanced ($0), BYOK ($30), Managed ($50).

## 🤖 THE COLONEL - AI AGENT SYSTEM

### Vision

An intelligent AI agent system that knows Ops-Center inside and out, can execute tasks, answer questions, and coordinate across multiple UC-Cloud instances.

### Architecture

```
🎖️ The Colonel (Ecosystem Orchestrator)
    │
    ├─ 🎖️ Lt. Colonel "Atlas" (Ops-Center System Agent)
    │   │
    │   ├─ 👤 Major "Roster" (Users & Orgs Specialist)
    │   ├─ 🤖 Major "Neural" (LLM & AI Specialist)
    │   ├─ 🏗️ Major "Forge" (Infrastructure Specialist)
    │   ├─ 🔗 Major "Link" (Integrations Specialist)
    │   ├─ 📈 Major "Sentinel" (Monitoring Specialist)
    │   └─ 🔐 Major "Guardian" (Security Specialist)
    │
    ├─ 🎖️ Lt. Colonel "Brigade-One" (Brigade System Agent)
    └─ 🎖️ Lt. Colonel "DeepSearch" (Center-Deep System Agent)
```

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Lt. Colonel Atlas (Single Super-Agent)**
- [ ] Create agent definition in Brigade
- [ ] Write comprehensive system prompt covering all Ops-Center sections
- [ ] Implement custom tools:
  - `ops_center_api_query()` - Call any API endpoint
  - `get_system_status()` - Service health and metrics
  - `manage_user()` - User CRUD operations
  - `check_billing()` - Lago/Stripe queries
  - `restart_service()` - Docker management
  - `query_logs()` - Search logs and errors
  - `generate_report()` - Analytics and insights
- [ ] Add chat interface to Ops-Center dashboard
- [ ] Implement context awareness (knows what page user is on)
- [ ] Test with real administrative tasks

**Phase 2: Specialist Majors (Optional - If Needed)**
- [ ] Create 6 specialist agents (Roster, Neural, Forge, Link, Sentinel, Guardian)
- [ ] Implement A2A coordination between Atlas and Majors
- [ ] Parallel task execution
- [ ] Deep domain expertise per section

**Phase 3: The Colonel (Ecosystem Orchestrator)**
- [ ] Create ecosystem-level orchestrator
- [ ] A2A protocol for multi-instance coordination
- [ ] Cross-system task delegation
- [ ] Unified command center

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for Phase 1, prioritize before production release

### Why This Matters

1. **User Experience**: Chat with an expert instead of navigating menus
2. **Efficiency**: "Create 5 test users with trial subscriptions" → Done
3. **Troubleshooting**: "Why is service X failing?" → Instant diagnosis
4. **Learning**: Natural language guide through complex workflows
5. **Scalability**: Manage multiple instances from one interface

---

## 💳 LIVE STRIPE TESTING READY

### Current State

- ✅ **Live Stripe API keys** configured (not test mode)
- ✅ **Stripe webhooks** configured and operational

   - Real-time cost tracking
   - Invoice generation

4. **Plan Upgrades/Downgrades**
   - Change subscription tiers
   - Proration handling
   - Immediate access changes

### Testing Plan

**User**: aaron@magicunicorn.tech will:
1. Add credits to account (real purchase)
2. Test LLM API calls with real models
3. Verify billing accuracy
4. Test upgrade/downgrade flows

**Expected Result**: Full end-to-end payment and billing workflow functional with real money.
